🧠 IBM - High Performance C++ Backend Developer Interview Questions (Printable)

------------------------------------------------------------

📘 C++ Language Internals
1. Difference between lvalues and rvalues? How do std::move() and std::forward() help?
2. Explain internals of unique_ptr and shared_ptr. How is thread-safety handled?
3. What is placement new? How do you handle exception safety with it?
4. Explain the Rule of Five. How does it help with resource ownership?
5. What is copy elision and RVO? How did C++17 change the rule?

🔧 Memory Management & Optimization
6. What is false sharing and how do you eliminate it?
7. How to align data structures for better cache usage?
8. How does mmap() and mlock() help with memory performance?
9. How does sendfile() or splice() support zero-copy I/O?
10. How would you profile a C++ service for latency bottlenecks using perf or cachegrind?

🧵 Concurrency & Multithreading
11. How to implement a lock-free producer-consumer queue using std::atomic?
12. When to use lock_guard vs unique_lock? When are condition variables better than atomics?
13. How do you use CPU affinity and NUMA binding for thread optimization?
14. Describe a deadlock scenario you’ve resolved in production.
15. What’s the difference between memory_order_seq_cst and acquire-release?

📦 STL & Data Structures
16. Compare std::vector, std::list, std::deque. When is each preferable?
17. How does std::unordered_map handle collisions? How to write a custom hash?
18. Difference between insert() and emplace() in high-throughput loops?
19. Internals of std::priority_queue. Where have you used it in backends?
20. How do container iteration invalidations cause runtime bugs?

⚙️ Linux & System Programming
21. How would you implement zero-copy IPC between two high-throughput processes?
22. What tools do you use for debugging and profiling (strace, lsof, gdb, perf)?
23. How do you daemonize a process with fork(), exec(), and signal handling?
24. What is heap fragmentation and how do you detect/fix it?
25. How would you tune a C++ backend on IBM Z / s390x for SIMD and memory alignment?
