threads ( std::thread, std::promise, std::future, std::async(std::launch::async || std::launch::defereed, func, args), std::mutex, std::recursive_mutex, std::lock_guard<std::mutex>, std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(m, std::defer_lock);

How delete knows how many bytes need to be deleted?
Placement new in C++ ?
placement new and explicit destrutor calling ?
pointer and reference diff and when to use pointer and when to use reference?
when u have multiple instances of a class, how the values getter/setter works on specific instance ? how this pointer reaches to the member functions?
vPtr, vTable ?
auto_ptr, unique_ptr, shared_ptr, week_ptr difference ?

struct, class object

structural padding and packing ?
Class, struct difference and which one need to be prefer ?
Why empty class size is 1 byte ?
How to check two objects belong to the same class or different ? (typeid)
Explicit constructor in c++ ?
Constructor delegation ?
Virtual destructor and constructor ?
Can we call constructor and destructor explicitly?
Why copy constructor take argument as reference?
Why we must return reference only in copy assignment ?
How to stop someone to inherit your class and someone override your function ?
How to stop someone to copying ur objects?
How to stop someone to take address of your object?
How to restrict a object to be created only in stack or heap ?
What are the places the initializer list must be used?
friend function and friend classes ?
Function chaining ?
object slicing ?
Code bloating ?
why we must define static data member of class in cpp file ?
Why template functions only defined inside header files?
template and template specialization?

how will you clear std::cin error ? std::cin.clear(); std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
How To Call Some Function Before main In C++?
what is std::variant , how it is differs from union ?
std::invoke and std::apply
std::ignore and std::tie
Difference between #include <stdio.h> and #include <cstudio> and which one to use ?
function pointers and Functor
Name mangling
how to access c in c++ and c++ in c ( extern "C")
How to overload pre and post increment ? as both increment uses operator ++ how compiler identifies pre or post ?
plain enum and c++ enum class diff ?


Exception :

what is std::noexcept ?
why c++ doesn't provide finally in try catch, like java ? (Because c++ provides even better alternate solution RAI, so no need of finally)
exception in constructor and destructor?
Stack unwinding ?

auto, decltype, typeid, static, const, override, final, mutable, constexpr, this 

what does list.end() contains?

Delete a number from std::vector<int> ?  use erase remove idiom
Remove duplicates from unsorted array ?  ( use hashmap std::unordered_map<int, bool> )
Search an elemnet from sorted array ?     ( bst )


Design Patterns

Implement:
Array
vector
Stack
Queue
List
BST ( set, map)
Hash ( unordered_map, unordered_set )
String lib class
unique_ptr, shared_ptr
scoped_lock, scoped_thread
Trie
Graph and sortest path
permutation
