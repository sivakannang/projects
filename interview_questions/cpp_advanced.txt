🧠 Advanced C++ Interview Questions for Senior/Principal Engineers (25 Questions)

------------------------------------------------------------

🔧 Language Design & Semantics
1. Explain the Rule of Five in C++. How would you design a resource-managing class adhering to it?
2. What are the key differences between C++98, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20? Which features do you use most and why?
3. What is copy elision and Return Value Optimization (RVO)? How did it change in C++17?
4. What is the One Definition Rule (ODR) and how do violations manifest?
5. How does C++ handle object slicing and how do you avoid it?

🧱 Memory Management & Ownership
6. Compare raw pointers, `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, and `weak_ptr`. When is each appropriate?
7. How do smart pointers handle custom deleters and reference counting?
8. What is a memory leak? How do you detect and resolve leaks in production code?
9. What is placement new and where have you used it?

🧵 Multithreading & Concurrency
10. Describe a thread-safe producer-consumer implementation using `std::queue`, `std::mutex`, and `std::condition_variable`.
11. When would you use `lock_guard` vs `unique_lock`?
12. What are atomics in C++? How do memory orderings like `memory_order_acquire` and `memory_order_release` work?
13. Have you ever written lock-free or wait-free code? What challenges did you face?
14. What tools do you use to debug or detect concurrency issues?

⚙️ Performance Optimization & Low Latency
15. How do you profile and optimize a high-frequency C++ application?
16. What are false sharing and cache line alignment? How do they affect multithreaded performance?
17. What is the impact of virtual functions on performance and how do you profile them?
18. Describe a situation where moving from heap to stack allocation improved performance.

📦 STL & Containers
19. Difference between `std::vector`, `std::deque`, and `std::list`. When would you use each?
20. How does `std::unordered_map` handle collisions? How would you implement a custom hash function?
21. What’s the difference between `emplace()` and `insert()` in STL containers?

🔨 Templates & Modern Features
22. Explain CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) and its benefits over virtual polymorphism.
23. What is SFINAE and how is it used in function overloading or metaprogramming?
24. What are concepts in C++20? How do they improve template safety?
25. What is type erasure? Where is it used in STL?
