Multi-Cloud Gateway (NooBaa) - Cheat Sheet
=========================================================

✅ What is NooBaa?

- NooBaa is a multi-cloud data gateway and object storage abstraction layer.
- Originally a startup, acquired by Red Hat (now IBM).
- Part of Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation.
- Provides a single S3-compatible endpoint for apps, abstracting storage location.

---

✅ Why NooBaa Exists

- Enterprises use multiple clouds + on-prem.
- Need flexibility to move data without changing apps.
- NooBaa:
    - Provides single S3 endpoint.
    - Allows seamless data movement across backends.
    - Helps avoid cloud vendor lock-in.

✅ Core Features

Single Namespace
-----------------
- One virtual bucket, even if data resides across:
    - AWS S3
    - Azure Blob
    - Google Cloud Storage
    - On-prem storage

Policy-Based Data Placement
----------------------------
- Define rules like:
    - New data → Cloud A
    - Older data → migrate to Cloud B
- Data migration is transparent to applications.

S3 Compatibility
----------------
- Full S3 API:
    - PUT
    - GET
    - HEAD
    - DELETE
    - multipart uploads
- No app code changes required.

Virtual Storage Pools
----------------------
- Logical groups of storage resources.
- NooBaa decides data placement.

Data Resiliency
---------------
- Erasure coding for protection.
- Data spread across nodes/backends.

Object Encryption
-----------------
- Supports encryption for compliance.
- Can integrate with external KMS.

Data Migration
--------------
- Seamless object migration across clouds.
- Example:
    - Start in AWS S3.
    - Migrate older objects to Azure.
    - App still uses same endpoint.

Multi-Tenancy
-------------
- Different tenants have isolated buckets and policies.

✅ How NooBaa Works

- Deployed (often on Kubernetes).
- Applications talk to NooBaa via S3 APIs.
- NooBaa:
    - Handles S3 requests.
    - Routes data to storage backend.
- Metadata stored in NooBaa’s internal DB.
- Data stored:
    - in cloud object storage
    - or locally on NooBaa nodes.

---

✅ NooBaa Architecture

- Core Service:
    - Handles metadata.
    - Exposes S3 API.

- NooBaa Agents/Data Nodes:
    - Store object data.
    - Connect to backend storage.

---

✅ Example Use Case

Scenario:
---------
- Company wants:
    - Recent data → AWS S3.
    - Older data → Azure for cost savings.
- Apps must remain unchanged.

Solution:
---------
- Deploy NooBaa gateway.
- Apps talk to NooBaa S3 endpoint.
- Policy:
    - age > 90 days → migrate to Azure.

Outcome:
--------
- No code changes.
- Seamless cloud mobility.

✅ NooBaa vs Traditional Gateways

| Feature            | NooBaa                      | Traditional Gateway      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Multi-cloud        | Yes                         | Usually single cloud     |
| Dynamic migration  | Yes                         | Often static mappings    |
| S3 compatibility   | Yes                         | Varies                   |
| Kubernetes-native  | Yes                         | Often hardware appliance |
| Policy engine      | Yes                         | Limited                  |

✅ Interview Quick Answer

> “NooBaa is a multi-cloud gateway that lets applications access object storage through a single S3-compatible endpoint, while data can reside across multiple clouds or on-prem storage. It supports policy-driven data placement, seamless migration, and helps avoid vendor lock-in.”

---

✅ IBM Context

- IBM focuses on:
    - Hybrid cloud.
    - Multi-cloud data management.
- OpenShift Data Foundation integrates NooBaa.
- Knowing NooBaa is a plus for IBM Storage roles.
